# prework-study-guide


## Description

The purpose of this project was to allow myself to learn the basics of Git, GITHUB, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
A primary driving motivation for the creation of this project was to be able to prepare myself for the 6 month coding boot camp.
While there are no inherent problems that needed to be solved, this was instead of demonstration basics skills needed to succeed in this upcoming bootcamp.
I learned a plethora of valuable information across the course of completeing this course. 
Some of this information consisted or basic JavaScript semantics, how to setup a repository for GitHub, How manage branches and push forward new updates in a structured manner. Other skills aquired also consisted of the ability to navigate GITHUB, code basic HTML and CSS.
